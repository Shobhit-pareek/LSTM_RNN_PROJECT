**Next_word_prediction_model**

This project is a Streamlit-based web application for predicting the next word in a text sequence using a pre-trained LSTM model. The app allows users to input a sequence of words and provides the most likely next word based on the model's prediction.

**Features:**

**- Interactive Interface:** Users can enter any text sequence to get predictions.

**- LSTM Model Integration:** A pre-trained LSTM model (next_word_prediction_lstm.h5) predicts the next word.

**- Tokenizer Utilization:** The app uses a tokenizer to preprocess text and ensure compatibility with the model.

**- Dynamic Sequence Length Handling:** Automatically adjusts input sequences to match the model's requirements.

**How It Works:**

**- Preprocessing:** The app uses the tokenizer to convert input text into sequences of integers.

**- Padding:** Ensures that the input sequence matches the required length of the LSTM model.

**- Prediction:** The LSTM model predicts probabilities for the next word. The app selects the word with the highest probability.

**- Output:** Displays the next word based on the prediction.
